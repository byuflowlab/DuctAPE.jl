taking the stuff from constant circulation rotor or elsewhere,
need to check on the wake induced velocity,
that is, pick a location or set of locations at which to find the wake induced velocity and calculate it.

I think that for a constant velocity wake, it should induce that same constant velocity inside the wake, and decrease outside of the wake. maybe...
