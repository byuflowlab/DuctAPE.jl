\renewcommand{\sectionquote}{\chapterprecishere{All models are approximations. Assumptions, whether implied or clearly stated, are never exactly true. \emph{All models are wrong, but some models are useful.} So the question you need to ask is not ``Is the model true?'' (it never is) but ``Is the model good enough for this particular application?'' The answer depends on two factors:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item How close to reality the assumptions are likely to be
         \item How robust (insensitive) the derived [methods] are to these likely departures from assumption
     \end{enumerate}
