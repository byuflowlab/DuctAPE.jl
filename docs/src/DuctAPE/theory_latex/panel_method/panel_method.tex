\chapter{A Vortex-based Axisymmetric Panel Method}
\label{ch:panel_method}

One of the major pieces of the DuctAPE solver is an axisymmetric panel method.
The implementation for an axisymmetric panel method is similar to the implementation of typical planar panel methods, but there are a few differences.
We include here details for the axisymmetric panel method used.
