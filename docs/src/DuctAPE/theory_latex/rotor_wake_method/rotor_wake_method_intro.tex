As briefly mentioned in \cref{ch:panel_method}, the main application in this work for the panel method is to model ducted rotors.
%
Along with the panel method to model the duct and center body of ducted rotors, we also need to model the rotor and rotor wake.
%
In this chapter, we address both the rotor and wake models which build on some aspects of the previous chapter as well as introduce several additional concepts.

We should note that in the last chapter we indicated the use of some concepts from the Ducted Fan Design Code (DFDC),\scite{DFDC} but for the most part the derivations for the panel method were completed from scratch.
%
In this chapter, we rely heavily on concepts developed in DFDC's theory document;\scite{DFDC} though in many cases we provide more detail in our versions of the derivations.
%
In addition, most of the figures in this chapter, although generated by our own efforts, are also heavily influenced by the excellent figures presented in the DFDC theory document.
