## Pre-compiling the Caches

There are several available caches that can be precompiled to help speed up multiple analyses.
The first is a cache used for intermediate calculations in the pre- and post-processing phases of the analysis.
It can be preallocated using `allocate_prepost_container_cache`

```@docs; canonical=false
DuctAPE.allocate_prepost_container_cache
```

The second is a cache containing parameters used in the solver, in other words, the results of the pre-processing phase.
It can be preallocated using `allocate_solve_parameter_cache`.

```@docs; canonical=false
DuctAPE.allocate_solve_parameter_cache
```

The final precompileable cache is for intermediate calculations within the solve and can be preallocated using `allocate_solve_container_cache`

```@docs; canonical=false
DuctAPE.allocate_solve_container_cache
```
