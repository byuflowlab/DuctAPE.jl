# CCBlade Airfoil Types

DuctAPE includes stripped-down versions of all the airfoil types as well as most of the methods available in [CCBlade](https://flow.byu.edu/CCBlade.jl/stable/reference/#Airfoil-Evaluation).
We include the modified airfoil types here.  The various methods are typically not necessary for the user to access, but the CCBlade documentation has more information on those methods if desired.
