# CCBlade Airfoil Types

DuctAPE includes all the airfoil types and methods available in [CCBlade](https://flow.byu.edu/CCBlade.jl/stable/reference/#Airfoil-Evaluation).  We repeat them here for convenience, but refer the user to the CCBlade documentation for more context if advanced usage is desired.
