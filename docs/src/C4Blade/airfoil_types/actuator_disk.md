# Actuator Disk Type

!!! warning "Warning"
    Actuator disk types are currently in development and not ready for general use.

DuctAPE currently implements an actuator disk type that can be used to directly define the rotor blade circulation.
Note that in the current implementation, values for circulation and source panel strength are set as constants and are unaffected by the solver in general.
