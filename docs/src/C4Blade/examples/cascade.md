# Cascade Types

!!! warning "Warning"
    Cascade types are currently in development and not ready for general use.

Cascade types are defined analogous to CCBlade airfoil types.
Instead of angle of attack, however, cascade types take in both inflow and stagger angles.
In addition, cascade types are dependent on local solidity.
