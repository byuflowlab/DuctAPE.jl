# DuctTAPE ([Duct](#)ed [T](#)wo-dimensional [A](#)ero[P](#)ropulsor [E](#)valuation)

Documentation for [DuctTAPE](https://github.com/byuflowlab/DuctTAPE.jl).

DuctTAPE is a code for the aerodynamic evaluation of 2D, axisymmetric, ducted propulsors design for incompressible aerodynamic applications (although hydrodynamic applications could also apply, but aero made the acronym work).

It is *heavily* based on the code [DFDC](http://web.mit.edu/drela/Public/web/dfdc/), but has been developed specifically for use in gradient based optimization.
