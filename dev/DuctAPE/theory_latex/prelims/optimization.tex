\section{Optimization}

Many of the studies in this dissertation involve the use of optimization techniques.
%
In this section, we will cover the basics of the major concepts of the optimization techniques used in this dissertation.


\subsection{Gradient-based Optimization}

All of the optimization in this work is done with gradient-based optimization techniques.
%
In general, gradient-based optimization can be described as any optimization method which utilizes the design space gradient in order to select which direction to search for the optimum.
%
The main limitation of gradient-based methods is that they require differentiable design spaces.
%
On the other hand, if the design space is differentiable, then gradient-based methods tend to be more efficient that gradient-free methods as problem size grows.

% \subsection{Multi-disciplinary Optimization}
