Cumulative sum of panel lengths for the given section of surface associated with the upper or lower boundary layer.

# Arguments:
- `duct_panel_lengths::Vector{Float}` : vector of panel lengths (called influence_length in body_vortex_panels) associated with the duct (casing + nacelle).

- `s::Vector{Float}` : cumulative sum of panel lengths between control points in the given index range, starting from zero.

"""
   split_at_stagnation_point(duct_panel_lengths, cp_duct)

Find the stagnation point as the point with local cp closest to 1.0.

# Arguments:
- `duct_panel_lengths::Vector{Float}` : Vector of panel lengths for the duct from casing trailing edge clockwise to nacelle trailing edge.
- `cp_duct::Vector{Float}` : Vector of surface pressure coefficients on duct from casing trailing edge clockwise to nacelle trailing edge.

# Returns:
- `s::Vector{Float}` : cumulative sum of distance along panels between control points starting at 0.
- `s_stagnation::Float` : surface length at which the stagnation point occurs, calculated using extrapolation technique described below
- `lower_length::Float` : length from stagnation point to casing trailing edge control point
- `upper_length::Float` : length from stagnation point to nacelle trailing edge control point


To determine point of intersection between extrapolated lines, we do the following:

Determine the point-slope form of the lines extrapolated from either side of the panel with a pressure coefficient closest to 1.0, and set up equations to find a point somewhere along each line

intersection    Known points on    unknown    slopes of
   point         each line         factors    each line
    P1 =       [s[i-2]; cp[i-2]] + x1    *   [ds1; dcp1]
    P2 =       [s[i+1]; cp[i+1]] + x2    *   [ds2; dcp2]

where if we set P1=P2, in other words, to be the point the lines intersect, we can solve for the unknown factors that yield the point of intersection.

We therefore set P1=P2 and assemble a system of linear equations, then plug one of the solved facotrs back into its associated equation to obtain the s location of intersection of the extrapolated lines and take this to be the stagnation point, regardless of what the pressure coefficient ends up being.
