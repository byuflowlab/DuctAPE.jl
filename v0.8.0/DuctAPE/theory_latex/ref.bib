An inviscid linear-vorticity panel method with a Karman-Tsien compressiblity correction is developed for direct and mixed-inverse modes. Source distributions superimposed on the airfoil and wake permit modeling of viscous layer influence on the potential flow. A two-equation lagged dissipation integral method is used to represent the viscous layers. Both laminar and turbulent layers are treated, with an e9-type amplification formulation determinining the transition point. The boundary layer and transition equations are solved simultaneously with the inviscid flowfield by a global Newton method. The procedure is especially suitable for rapid analysis of low Reynolds number airfoil flows with transitional separation bubbles. Surface pressure distributions and entire polars are calculated and compared with experimental data. Design procedure examples are also presented.},

@article{Glauert_1928,
    abstract = { At ordinary aeroplane speeds the effect of the compressibility of the air is very small, and there is complete justification for the usual assumption that the air may be regarded effectively as an incompressible medium. This assumption, however, ceases to be valid in the case of high tip-speed airscrews and is not really satisfactory even when the tip speed is no greater than 800 f. p. s. It is important, therefore, to examine, both theoretically and experimentally, the effect of compressibility at high speed on the characteristics of an aerofoil. Experimental investigations are in progress at the Royal Aircraft Establishment in which the aerofoil characteristics are derived by analysing the observed behaviour of high-speed model airscrews, but owing to the complexity both of the experiments and of the analysis it is impossible that the results should have the same accuracy as those obtained from direct tests of an aerofoil at low speed. An attempt has now been made to estimate theoretically the effect of compressibility on the lift of an aerofoil in two-dimensional motion and to indicate the nature of the variation which may be anticipated in the curve of lift coefficient against angle of incidence. It is unfortunately impossible at the present state of knowledge to make any similar calculation for the drag of the aerofoil, but on general grounds we may anticipate that the drag coefficient will rise at an increasing rate until the velocity of sound is reached, and that above this speed the drag coefficient will decrease again, remaining, however, higher than at low speeds. },

	abstract = {Abstract

              The paper presents an extension to ducted rotors of the nonlinear actuator disk theory of Conway (
              J. Fluid Mech.
              , vol. 365, 1998, pp. 235--267) and it is exact for incompressible, axisymmetric and inviscid flows. The solution for the velocities and the Stokes stream function results from the superposition of ring vortices properly arranged along the duct surface and the wake region. Using a general analytical procedure the flow fields are given as a combination of one-dimensional integrals of expressions involving complete as well as incomplete elliptic integrals. The solution being exact, the proper shape of the slipstream whether converging or diverging is naturally accounted for, even for heavy loads. A semi-analytical method has been developed that enables the flow induced by an actuator disk housed in a contoured duct to be solved duly accounting for the nonlinear mutual interaction between the duct and the rotor. Non-uniform load distributions, rotor wake rotation and ducts of general shapes and thickness distribution can be dealt with. Thanks to its reduced numerical cost, the method is well suited for the design and/or analysis of ducted rotors for marine, wind and aeronautical applications.},

@article{Glauert_1928,
	abstract = { At ordinary aeroplane speeds the effect of the compressibility of the air is very small, and there is complete justification for the usual assumption that the air may be regarded effectively as an incompressible medium. This assumption, however, ceases to be valid in the case of high tip-speed airscrews and is not really satisfactory even when the tip speed is no greater than 800 f. p. s. It is important, therefore, to examine, both theoretically and experimentally, the effect of compressibility at high speed on the characteristics of an aerofoil. Experimental investigations are in progress at the Royal Aircraft Establishment in which the aerofoil characteristics are derived by analysing the observed behaviour of high-speed model airscrews, but owing to the complexity both of the experiments and of the analysis it is impossible that the results should have the same accuracy as those obtained from direct tests of an aerofoil at low speed. An attempt has now been made to estimate theoretically the effect of compressibility on the lift of an aerofoil in two-dimensional motion and to indicate the nature of the variation which may be anticipated in the curve of lift coefficient against angle of incidence. It is unfortunately impossible at the present state of knowledge to make any similar calculation for the drag of the aerofoil, but on general grounds we may anticipate that the drag coefficient will rise at an increasing rate until the velocity of sound is reached, and that above this speed the drag coefficient will decrease again, remaining, however, higher than at low speeds. },

	abstract = { This paper presents a self-contained, comprehensive exposition and new elements of a classic airfoil analysis technique: an integral boundary-layer solver coupled to a vortex-panel potential-flow method. The resulting solver MFOIL, implemented in MATLAB and made freely available, builds on the XFOIL code and documentation, which serve as the inspiration, reference, and standard of comparison. Modifications made in the present implementation include an augmented-state coupled solver for more control in limiting the state update, a new stagnation-point formulation to reduce leading-edge oscillations in the boundary-layer variables, and a more robust treatment of the amplification rate near transition. Several results highlight these modifications and demonstrate capabilities of the code. },

	abstract = { This paper concerns an acceleration method for fixed-point iterations that originated in work of D. G. Anderson [J. Assoc. Comput. Mach., 12 (1965), pp. 547--560], which we accordingly call Anderson acceleration here. This method has enjoyed considerable success and wide usage in electronic structure computations, where it is known as Anderson mixing; however, it seems to have been untried or underexploited in many other important applications. Moreover, while other acceleration methods have been extensively studied by the mathematics and numerical analysis communities, this method has received relatively little attention from these communities over the years. A recent paper by H. Fang and Y. Saad [Numer. Linear Algebra Appl., 16 (2009), pp. 197--221] has clarified a remarkable relationship of Anderson acceleration to quasi-Newton (secant updating) methods and extended it to define a broader Anderson family of acceleration methods. In this paper, our goals are to shed additional light on Anderson acceleration and to draw further attention to its usefulness as a general tool. We first show that, on linear problems, Anderson acceleration without truncation is ``essentially equivalent'' in a certain sense to the generalized minimal residual (GMRES) method. We also show that the Type 1 variant in the Fang--Saad Anderson family is similarly essentially equivalent to the Arnoldi (full orthogonalization) method. We then discuss practical considerations for implementing Anderson acceleration and illustrate its performance through numerical experiments involving a variety of applications. },

	abstract = {Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) represents a collaborative vision shared by NASA, regulatory agencies, and global industry leaders, aimed at establishing a robust and reliable air transportation ecosystem, which is expected to facilitate safe and efficient movement of both people and cargo within urban, suburban, and regional environments. This paper presents a holistic review and analysis encompassing various aircraft designs, including different propulsion system designs and architectures (electric, hybrid electric, turboelectric, etc.), for different AAM aircraft applications, and state-of-the-art air traffic management, cybersecurity, and infrastructure strategies. Recent academic and industry literature on these aspects is critically reviewed and summarized, and a compilation of the aircraft models currently in development is also provided. The aircraft designs are categorized into a set of core groups, which include lift + cruise, tilt-wing, tiltrotor, multirotor, and rotorcraft, to analyze the existing literature systematically. For each of these core groups, literature on different propulsion system designs and architectures is reviewed and analyzed. Next, these core groups, including their variations based on propulsion system designs and architectures, are analyzed through a set of evaluation lenses. This provides a comprehensive insight into their respective strengths, weakness, and gaps in design considerations. The identified lenses include range and payload, performance, environmental impact, feasibility, traffic and infrastructure, noise, vehicle safety, and cybersecurity. Finally, directions for future research in AAM aircraft and overall ecosystem development are identified. In general, a more in-depth, quantitative analysis on the various evaluation lenses identified in this study and appropriate consideration to all these evaluation lenses at the design and development stage are highly recommended. This type of holistic approach will drive AAM aircraft designs towards convergence and help build an efficient, affordable, and sustainable AAM ecosystem.},

abstract = {The development of software for minimization problems is often based on a line search method. We consider line search methods that satisfy sufficient decrease and curvature conditions, and formulate the problem of determining a point that satisfies these two conditions in terms of finding a point in a set T(μ).  We describe a search algorithm for this problem that produces a sequence of iterates that converge to a point in T(μ) and that, except for pathological cases, terminates in a finite number of steps. Numerical results for an implementation of the search algorithm on a set of test functions show that the algorithm terminates within a small number of iterations.},

@article{Tachmindji_1958,
	abstract = {The potential problem is solved for the circulation distribution of an optimum propeller with finite number of blades when operating in a cylindrical duct. The effects of the duct on both the circulation and the thrust increase have been calculated for specific cases, showing that they become important for propellers operating in a duct having a diameter which approaches the propeller diameter. The effect of the duct increases with decreasing number of blades and with increasing pitch. The percentage increase in thrust which has been computed is additive to the Woodand Harris correction resulting from the contraction of the slipstream.},
