approach case is the one to look at it seems.

RPM = 7808 for this case (see readme for hotwire data)
(according to aero paper, RMPc is 12657*0.61 = 7720.7699999999995 RPM)

freestream Mach was 0.05 in the test section. for all tests

variable exhaust will be difficult to model how they did it experimentally, but perhaps modifying the geometry somehow could work?

hotwire data for station 1 is what we want to compare.
station 1 is 4 inches aft of the rotor stacking axis (stacking axis is zero in the geometry files)

22 rotor blades

22 inch fan diameter

54 stator blades

want to use U_1.data.txt (mean axial), V_1.data (mean tangential), and W_1.data (mean radial) files
for comparison at 4 inches aft of rotor stacking axis.
rows in these files are the radial stations, and columns are the 65 stations located across the blade pitch at 2*pi*r/(65*22) (what does this mean, blade pitch?)
    not sure how to handle these values. do we just take the average of all of them circumferentially?
need to get first column of Immersion_stations.data to get the radial locations associated with the data in the velocity files.
may consider using the time series data to get some standard deviations for "error bars".
